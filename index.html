						<h1>Agriculture Worker Shortage</h1>
						<hr>
						<p>
							"Agriculture and Agri-Food is a High Growth Industry: Canadian farmers feed the world, and
							demand for Canadian food is growing.
							Farmers need a secure workforce to allow Canada to participate in new trade agreements and
							to remain 5th largest Agri-food
							exporter in the world."
						</p>
						<p>
							"Research conducted by the Canadian Agricultural Human
							Resource Council (CAHRC) shows a critical gap between the demand for workers and the supply
							of available workers. This gap has
							doubled in the past 10 years to approximately 60,000 workers."
						</p>
						<p>
							Agriculture & Agri-Food worker shortage contributes to:
							<ul>
								<li>hollowing out and economically suffocating rural communities across Canada</li>
								<li>worsening Canada’s rural de-population</li>
								<li>lost wages & jobs for Canadian workers</li>
								<li>farmers & processors losing export opportunities and farm gate returns putting
									agri-business at risk</li>
								<li>jeopardizing Canada’s global market position as an Agriculture & Agri-Food export
									leader</li>
							</ul>
